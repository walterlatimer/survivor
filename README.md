# Survivor Through the Seasons

This began as a live-coding breakout on object oriented design that I presented at Wyncode, walking through the basic mechanics of the reality show *Survivor*. The first commit is the live coding we completed in class.

*Survivor*'s game mechanics have undergone numerous changes throughout the seasons. Some seasons have a final three while others have a final two. Hidden Immunity Idols were later introduced to include additional immunity. Some seasons have tribe swaps which shuffle the tribes after a few episodes.

It occured to me that this would make a better exercise in OOD than I had initially thought. I am currently challenging myself to design a set of objects that can accomodate the shifting mechanics of the thirty existing seasons of *Survivor*.
